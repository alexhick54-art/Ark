Files taken from it, with Ark's changes marked `Ark:` in the code:

| Ark path | LAS path | Ark changes |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/lifter/lifter.py` | `tools/lifter.py` | 64-bit `LDXP`/`LDAXP`/`STXP`/`STLXP` (128-bit exclusive pairs) |
| `tools/lifter/gen.py` | `tools/gen.py` | on-demand page mapping during jump-table emulation; masked-index tables; `adr` jump-table bases no longer split functions |
| `tools/lifter/nso.py` | `tools/nso.py` | pure-Python LZ4 fallback (`tools/lifter/lz4.py`, Ark's own) |
| `tools/lifter/analyze.py` | `tools/analyze.py` | `capstone` only imported by the census |
| `tools/lifter/simd_c.py` | `tools/simd_c.py` | none |
| `tools/lifter/passes.py` | `tools/passes.py` | none |
| `tools/lifter/test_lift.py` | `tools/test_lift.py` | Linux/x86-64 host support (portable SIMD mode, OpenSSL MD5) |
| `tools/lifter/test_harness.c` | `tools/test_harness.c` | Linux/x86-64 host support |
| `runtime/include/cpu.h` | `runtime/cpu.h` | `excl_val2`, `ldxp64`/`stxp64` |
| `runtime/include/simd.h` | `runtime/simd.h` | none |
| `runtime/include/simd_fp.h` | `runtime/simd_fp.h` | none |
| `tools/lifter/gen.py` (again) | | resolved jump tables no longer get the all-instruction fallback (`rt_jt_miss`) |
| `runtime/rt.h` | `runtime/rt.h` | module bases for four modules; 64 GB guest window; 48 GB alias region |
| `runtime/loader.c` | `runtime/loader.c` | four modules (main, multimedia, glslc, sdk) |
| `runtime/dispatch.c` | `runtime/dispatch.c` | four statically linked function tables (no game library loader yet); `rt_jt_miss` |
| `runtime/kernel.c`, `kernel.h` | same | `svcGetInfo` 16/17 (system resource size); `svcMapPhysicalMemory` keeps mapped pages, `svcUnmapPhysicalMemory` discards; merged physical-mapping regions |
| `runtime/ipc.c`, `ipc.h`, `hle.h`, `fnprof.c`, `platform.h` | same | `plat_discard` added to `platform.h` |
| `runtime/platform/linux.c`, `linux_compat.h`, `windows.c`, `win_compat.h` | `runtime/platform/` | headless build (no SDL message box), log redirect only with `ARK_LOG_DIR`, `plat_discard` |
| `runtime/services/*.c` | `runtime/services/` | none (LAS-only hooks satisfied by `runtime/stubs.c`, `rando.h`, `settings.h`) |
| `runtime/hle/heaps.c`, `vi.c`, `pl.c`, `nvn_boot.c`, `swkbd.c` | `runtime/hle/` | none |
| `runtime/romfs_build.c`, `romfs_build.h` | same | none |

| `runtime/nvn/` (objects, cmdbuf, tegra, formats, astc, output_scale, smaa_data, maxwell/, vulkan/) | `runtime/nvn/` | Vulkan device: request only the 1.1-1.3 features the device has (CPU test drivers); the Metal backend and `texpatch.c` (Link's Awakening texture edits) are not taken |
| `runtime/hle/input.c`, `bindings.c`, `runtime/input_bind.h` | same | Link's Awakening per-frame hooks (warps, randomizer items, door jumps, d-pad walking) removed |
| `runtime/settings.h` / `settings.c` | same | Ark's own, keeping LAS's display / audio options and their meaning |

Ark's own files in `runtime/`: `main.c` (based on LAS's), `stubs.c`, `rando.h`, `headless/SDL3/SDL.h`,
`las_hooks_none.c`, `ui_none.c`, `ui/menu.h`, `paths.h`, `nvn/texpatch_none.c`, `hle/fslog.c`.
